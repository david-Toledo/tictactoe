Tic-tac-toe
=========================================================
This is the fist project in General Assembly.
Tic-tac-toe or also called "X's and O's" or "Gato" in my Country which means "cat", is a very well known game around the world. No matter if you are old or young. Everyone has seen it or played it at least once. This was basically a paper and pencil game for 2 players but now with the technology is also digital), X and O, who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.

How to play
==============================================================
The game is in a 3x3 grid played by 2 people.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins!
If no one succeeds and the tic-tac-toe runs out of empty spaces its a draw game and the game re-starts.
There is a counter below to show how many times the player X or player O has won.

Known Bugs
===============================================================
If you try to click in a box for several times the user receives as many times the message of "choose Player" in the screen.
