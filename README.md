Tic-tac-toe
=========================================================
This is the fist project in General Assembly.
Tic-tac-toe or also called "X's and O's" or "Gato" in my Country which means cat is a very well known game around the world. No matter if you are old or young. Everyone has seen it or played it at least once. This is basically a paper and pencil game for 2 players, X and O, who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.
